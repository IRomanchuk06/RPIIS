\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[A semantic continuous similarity of sc-structures*
connects an sc-set of sc-structures* with a
connected sc-structure* sc-relation of semantic
similarity by slot sc-relations si, sj so that for
each sc-structure* from sc-set find its element
and the tuple of this similarity sc-relation, in
which it enters under the slot sc-relation si, and
under the slot sc-relation sj there is an element of
the connected sc-structure*, also for each element
of the connected sc-structure there is a tuple of
this sc- a similarity relation in which it enters
under the slot sc-relation sj, and under the slot screlation si the element of the sc-structure* from
the sc-set enters.]

neighborhood of any element is an sc-subset of

the union of their full semantic neighborhoods.] \\



\noindent \textbf{\textit{topological space}}

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[A topological space is a set with a set (family)
of (open) subsets defined over it, including the
set itself and the empty set. For any subset of
the family, the result of the union belongs to the
family, and for any finite subset of the family,
the result of the intersection also belongs to the
family. The complements of the sets of a family
to the largest of the sets are called closed sets.]\\

\noindent \textbf{\textit{topological space of connector incidence closure}}

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[A topological space of connector incidence clo-
sure on a set of sc-elements is a topological space,
all closed sets of which contain all sc-elements
of this set, to which there is a route along
oriented connectives of the incidence relation
of connectors.]

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{note*:}

[In the general case, it does not satisfy the
Tikhonov separability axiom. The pragmatics of
considering such spaces is determined by the
operations of removing sc-elements and connec-
tors with which they are incident. Deleting an sc
element requires deleting all connectors whose
closure of any open neighborhood it belongs to.]

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{first domain*:}

\noindent \textbf{\textit{topological space of syntactic closure'}}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[A topological space of syntactic closure on a set
of sc-elements is a topological space, all closed
sets of which contain all sc-elements of this set, to
which there is a route along oriented connectives
of the incidence relation.]

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{note*:}

[In the general case, it does not satisfy the Kol-
mogorov separability axiom. Syntactic closure \\ \\ \\
\end{itemize}

 \noindent can be singled out as the basis of closed sets
of a topological space, however, due to the
possibility of drawing arcs from any sc-node to
any, in the final case (as a result of the process
of eliminating non-factors), such a space is a
trivial (antidiscrete) space. The union relation
of topological spaces of syntactic closure is not
algebraically closed on the set of topological
spaces of syntactic closure. For the same reason,
for any incomplete topological space of syntactic
closure, one can consider a topological space of
syntactic closure whose support is a superset of
the support of the former and which does not
preserve closed sets. In this sense, the topology
based on syntactic closure is not stable with
respect to the processes of knowledge formation
and its consideration is not pragmatically justified.
The topology of the complete topological space
of syntactic closure is antidiscrete (trivial). Thus,
for a complete topological space of syntactic
closure, all topological subspaces of syntactic
closure have antidiscrete (trivial) topology.] \\




\noindent \textbf{\textit{topological space of entitive closure}}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[The topological space of an entitive closure on
the set of sc-elements is a topological space all
of whose closed sets are entitive closures.]

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{note*:}

[In the general case, it does not satisfy the
Tikhonov separability axiom. An entitive closure
can be considered as a support of a topological
(sub)space of entitive closure. The topological
space of entitive closure preserves the closed
sets of any topological spaces of entitive closure
whose support is a subset of its support and an
entitive closure. Such spaces form a structure of
topological subspaces – topological superspaces
of entitive closure. The topology of spaces in
this structure is diverse.] \\

\noindent \textbf{\textit{topological space of substantial closure}}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[The topological space of a substantial closure on
the set of sc-elements is a topological space all
of whose closed sets are substantial closures.]

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{note*:}

[In the general case, it does not fit the axiom of
separability according to Tikhonov. An substantial closure can be considered as a support of
a topological (sub)space of substantial closure.
The topological space of a substantial closure
preserves closed any topological spaces of a
substantial closure whose support is a subset
of its support and a substantial closure. Such
spatial formations of topological subspaces are
topological superspaces of substantial closure.
Topology of spaces in this vast area.] \\

\indent There is a possible transition from sc-structures to manifolds and topological spaces by reducing sc-structures
to graph structures. The issues of reducing sc-structures
to graph structures and further towards to manifolds and
topological spaces are considered in detail in [4] (see \ref{fig).

\noindent \textbf{\textit{metric}}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5em,labelindent=12.5mm,labelsep=6.3mm]

\item[$\Rightarrow$] \hspace{1em} \textit{explanation*:}

[A metric is a function of two arguments that
takes values on a (linearly) ordered support
of the group, is non-negative, is equal to the
neutral element (zero) only when the arguments
are equal, is symmetric, satisfies the triangle
inequality.] \\

arguments defined on it, which is a metric that
takes values on the ordered support of the group.] \\

\item[$\Rightarrow$]\textit{explanation*:}

[A metric finite syntactic space of the SC-code

elements are designations (sc-elements), and the
value of the metric can be determined through
the incidence relations of the elements without
taking into account their semantic type.] \\
