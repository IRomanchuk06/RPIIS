\label{1}\textsc{I.   The feature of the current state of work in the field of Artificial intelligence—is the transition to the next-generation intelligent computer systems.}\\
\end{center}
The epicenter of the modern stage of automation of human activity is a low level of automation and high overhead costs
\begin{itemize}
    \item for the system integration of various computer systems, in other words, for the creation of complicated hierarchical computer complexes;
    \item \hyperref[1]{for the modernization of computer systems during their operation [1].}
\end{itemize}


Modern computer systems clearly lack the \textit{intelligence} and \textit{autonomy} to automate these aspects of human activity.


The necessity to move from modern \textit{computer systems} (including modern \textit{intelligent computer systems}) to next-
generation \textit{intelligent computer systems} is due to the necessity to move to automate more and more complex types and areas of \textit{human activity} requiring the creation of whole complexes of \textit{intelligent computer systems} that
can independently \uline{evolve} and \uline{interact} effectively with each other in the \textit{\uline{collective} solution of complex problems.}


Computer systems with these abilities are the \textit{new
generation computer systems}. Since these \textit{computer systems} cannot but have a high level of \textit{intelligence}, they should also be referred to as \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}. A high level of \textit{intelligence} is necessary for next-generation computer systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item to adequately assessment their own competence and the competence of their partners; 
    \item to ensure mutual understanding, contractual capacity and coordination (consistency) of their actions with the actions of partners in the course of \textit{collective solution of complex problems} in the conditions of possible occurrence of unpredictable (non-standard) circumstances.
\end{itemize}

Our proposed approach to the construction of the next- generation intelligent computer systems is based on the following principles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \uline{semantic} representation of knowledge stored in the memory of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems};
    \item \uline{ontological} structuring and systematization of knowledge stored in memory;
    \item \uline{decentralized} situational agent-oriented organization of \textit{problem solving processes};
    \item \uline{convergence} and deep (diffuse) integration of various
problem solving models and, as a consequence, the
hybrid nature of \textit{problem solvers};
    \item \uline{semantic integration} of input information entering
an individual intelligent computer system from the outside through different sensory channels and in different languages by translating input information into a common universal \textit{language of internal semantic representation of knowledge}..

\label{2}\textsc{II.   Problems of the current stage of development of the theory and technology of next-generation intelligent computer systems.}
\end{center}
The creation of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} requires answers to the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the requirements for \textit{intelligent computer systems} that provide the above \uline{complex} automation of\textit{ human activities};
    \item Why modern intelligent computer systems do not meet these requirements and, accordingly, why the transition to a fundamentally \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems is necessary};
    \item What fundamental principles should underlie the \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems};
    \item What principles should underlie the \uline{most automated technology} for designing and supporting the entire life cycle of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems};
    \item What principles should underlie the structure and organization of various types and areas of \textit{human activity} to ensure its comprehensive and maximum possible automation with the help of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} (as you know, before automating any \textit{human activity}, it is necessary to put it in order — automating disorder leads to even greater disorder).
\end{itemize}
The current fundamental problems of creating the theory and technology of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of a \uline{theory} of hierarchical \textit{multi-agent systems} in which agents are individual or collective \textit{intelligent computer systems that are interoperable}.
    \item \uline{Unification} and \uline{standardization} of various models of knowledge representation and processing. The effect of this unification will not be visible immediately. But if this does not happen, we will never come to an effective \uline{comprehensive automation} of \textit{human activity}. The eclectic variety of automation methods and tools leads not only to unjustified \uline{duplication} of the systems being developed, but also to an increase in the complexity of their use and maintenance.
    \item \uline{Convergence} and \uline{integration} of different areas of \textit{Artificial Intelligence}.
Currently, various areas of \textit{Artificial Intelligence} have a fairly high level of development (signal processing, natural language processing, logical models, artificial neural networks, ontological models, multi-agent models, and many others). Integration of all these directions is a rather time-consuming problem, but it is quite a solvable one, which is based on the harmonization of related notions.
    \item \uline{Convergence} of such activities in the field of\textit{ Artificial Intelligence} as:
\end{itemize}
– training of specialists in the field of \textit{Artificial
Intelligence};\\
– engineering activities for the development of applied \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems};\\
– development of \textit{technology} for designing and supporting the life cycle of \textit{next-generation intelligent
computer systems};\\
– research activities in the field of \textit{Artificial intelligence}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item In order to develop the Technology of \textit{next-
generation intelligent computer systems}, it is also necessary to \uline{converge} this Technology \uline{with all}
\end{itemize}
