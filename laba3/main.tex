    \item Open-source and free: Protégé is a free and opensource ontology editor, which makes it accessible to anyone who wants to use it.
    \item User-friendly interface: Protégé has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit, and manipulate ontologies.
    \item Strong community support: Protégé has a strong community of academic government, and corporate users who use it to build knowledge-based
solutions in various areas such as bio-medicine, e-commerce, and organizational modeling. This support ensures that Protégé is continually updated and maintained.
    \item  Customizable: Protégé allows users to customize
their ontologies by adding new classes and properties and modifying existing ones.
    \item  Integration with other tools: Protégé can be integrated with other tools such as reasoners and
visualization plugins, which makes it a powerful
tool for ontology development.

 \chapter{IV. ONTOLOGICAL MODEL} 
\end{center}
\vspace{7pt}
\par The domain ontological model was built using
the Protégé editor. We have identified the following three classes: "Documents", "Events", "People".
The "TextDocuments", "Pictures", "Video" and "Audio".
Class "People" — subclasses "Graduates", "Directors",
"Mentors". The "Events" class is subclasses corresponding to the reign of one or another director of the corps.
\par The structure of the upper level of the ontology "History of the Polotsk Cadet Corps" is shown in Figure 1.

\chapter{V. CREATION OF THE INTELLIGENT INFORMATION
AND REFERENCE SYSTEM}
\end{center}
\vspace{7pt}
\par We plan to complete the creation of the Intellectual Information and Reference System "History of the Polotsk
Cadet Corps" using the OSTIS technology stack. We list
the advantages of this approach, which guarantee the
success of the completion of the project as a whole.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item  Any OSTIS — system can be easily supplemented
with new knowledge or new methods for solving
problems. This allows you to quickly and easily
repurpose the developed intelligent system, reorienting it to a new range of tasks to be solved.
    \item OSTIS — the system is focused on the reuse of
the developed components. Thanks to a single and
universal SC code, a library of typical components
can be created, the use of which in the design

process can reduce development time by 40-60 percent.
\item OSTIS — the system is reflexive, i.e. can analyze
itself, due to the fact that it is fully described
using the SC code. Reflexivity is one of the most
important qualities of intelligent systems.
    \item Due to the fact that the design of OSTIS —
the system is reduced to the construction of its
SC-model, it is completely platform-independent,
and can be implemented both in software and in
hardware.
    \item Hardware implementation involves the creation of
a new generation of computing devices — semantic
computers.

\chapter{VI. CONCLUSION}
\end{center}
\par In conclusion, we note the following. Ontological
modeling is an important method for developing intelligent information and reference systems. By focusing on relationships between concepts and entities, this
approach ensures that knowledge is represented in an
intuitive and machine-readable way.
\par With the help of ontological modeling, one can define
a subject area, develop a conceptual model, create and
populate an ontology with data, and finally put the
ontology into action. Although it can be a complex
process, the benefits of ontology modeling are clear: it
provides a foundation for building powerful applications
that address a variety of application problems.
\par An effective tool for building ontologies is the Protégé
editor. It allows you to create classes, slots and instances,
and also provides an easy way to modify ontologies without creating inconsistent data and knowledge. Protégé
can be used for practical applications, such as creating
ontologies for intelligent information retrieval systems,
\end{multicols}
\clearpage
\begin{multicols}{2}
as well as for educational purposes, such as creating
ontology models for e-learning.
\par Note also that Protégé can be easily integrated with
other software used to work with ontologies. Based on
the ontology created by Protégé tools, using the OSTIS
technology stack, you can quickly create an Intelligent
Information Retrieval System or a digital archive of an
organization.
\par Returning to the IIRS "History of the Polotsk Cadet
Corps", we note that the electronic resource created as
a result of the above steps can be used in at least
three organizations. In the Euphrosyne Polotskaya State
University of Polotsk — as an exhibit of the Museum
of the History of Science and Education of Polotsk, in
the Polotsk Cadet Corps — as an exhibit of the corps
museum being created, as well as in the exposition of
the Polotsk National Historical and Cultural MuseumReserve . In addition, the resource will certainly find
application in the educational process of Polotsk State
University.

\chapter{I. INTRODUCTION}
\end{center}
\par Educators have long shared a common desire to use
computers to automate teaching and learning services. In
recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence
technology, this wish is likely to become a reality. The
most representative product combining artificial intelligence and education is the intelligent tutoring system
(ITS), which can not only improve the learning efficiency
of users, but also ensure the fairness and impartiality of
the education process [9].
\par Automatic generation of test questions and automatic
verification of user answers are the most basic and
important functions of ITS. Using these two functions
in combination will enable the entire process from the
automatic generation of test questions to the automatic
scoring of the user test papers. This will not only greatly
reduce the repetitive work of educators, but will also
reduce the cost of user learning, thus providing more
users with the opportunity to learn various knowledge
[1], [2], [7].
\par Although in recent years, with the development of
technologies such as the semantic web, deep learning and
natural language processing (NLP), several approaches
have been proposed for the automatic generation of test
questions and the automatic verification of user answers,
these approaches have the following main disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item existing approaches to generating test questions allow only the simplest objective questions to be generated;
    \item some existing approaches (for example, keyword matching and probability statistics) to verifying user
    \columnbreak
    \item[] answers to subjective questions do not consider the semantic similarity between answers;
    \item methods that use semantic to verify user answers to subjective questions can only calculate similarity between answers with simple semantic structures [7], [8], [10].
\end{itemize}
\par Objective questions usually have a unique standard answer. In this article, objective questions include: multiplechoice questions, fill in the blank questions and judgment
questions. Objective questions differ from subjective
questions, which have more than one potential correct
answer. Subjective questions in this article include: definition explanation questions, proof questions and problemsolving task.
\par Therefore, based on existing methods and OSTIS Technology, an approach to developing a universal subsystem
for automatic generation of test questions and automatic
verification of user answers in tutoring systems developed
using OSTIS Technology (Open Semantic Technology
for Intelligent Systems) is proposed in this article [1],
[2], [5]. The universality of the subsystem means that the
developed subsystem can be easily transplanted to other
ostis-systems (system built using OSTIS Technology). The
developed subsystem allows the use of the knowledge
bases of the ostis-systems to automatically generate
various types of test questions and automatically verify
the completeness and correctness of user answers based
on the semantic description structures of the knowledge.
The discrete mathematics ostis-system will be used as
demonstration systems for the developed subsystem.
