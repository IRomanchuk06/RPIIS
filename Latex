types and \textit{areas of human} activity that are not
 part of the activities in the field of \textit{Artificial Intelligence}. The development of the technology of \textit{
next-generation intelligent computer systems} has a
pronounced \uline{interdisciplinary character}. This means
that \uline{all the knowledge} accumulated by \textit{human society}
in various fields should be represented as part of
the Global \textit{Knowledge Base} of the Ecosystem of
\textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} (using
portals of scientific, technical, administrative and
other knowledge), should be clearly \uline{stratified} in
the form of a hierarchical system of \uline{semantically
compatible} reusable \textit{ontologies} and transformed
into a hierarchical system semantically compatible
\textit{formal} components of knowledge bases of \textit{intelligent
computer systems} for various applications.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item  Ensuring \uline{semantic compatibility} of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} not only at the stage of their design, but also at all subsequent stages of their life cycle.
    \item Development of a model of \uline{collective} behavior of  \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, in other words, a model of decentralized collective problem solving at the level of:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.4cm]
     \item  a \textit{multi-agent system} whose agents are \uline{internal agents} of an \textit{individual intelligent computer system} interacting through a common memory (through a common \textit{knowledge base} stored in \uline{one} memory);
     \item a \textit{multi-agent} system whose agents are \textit{interoperable intelligent computer systems} interacting through a common \textit{ knowledge base} stored in the memory of a \textit{corporate intelligent computer system} or in the memory of the coordinator of the activities of a \uline{temporar}y collective of \textit{intelligent computer systems.}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{adjustwidth}
 \hspace{3mm} Within the framework of the theory of \textit{collective}
\textit{problem solving}, the following problem situations can be
distinguished:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.8cm]
\item a problem that can be solved by the \textit{individual intelligent computer system} in which this task is initiated;
\item a problem corresponding to the competence of the collective of \textit{intelligent computer systems} within which this problem was initiated;
\item  a problem that goes beyond the competence of the \textit{ \uline{collective} of intelligent computer systems} within which this problem was initiated. Such a problem requires the formation of a \uline{temporary} team, the
\uline{coordinator} (but not the manager) of which becomes
the \textit{intelligent computer system} within which the
specified problem was initiated. To do this, it is
necessary to find those \textit{intelligent computer systems}
that together will provide the necessary competence.
At the same time, note that each \textit{interoperable
intelligent computer system} (both individual and
collective) must \uline{know} its competence in order to
determine whether it can or cannot solve a given
(arisen) task. This, in particular, is necessary for
the formation of \uline{temporary} collectives of \textit{intelligent
computer systems}.
\item Development of the principles underlying a powerful Library of reusable and compatible components of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, which provides \uline{full} automation of the integration of these components in the assembly process of the designed systems.
\item Development of methods and means of permanent expansion of the Library of reusable components of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} in various fields of \textit{human activity}:
\item Scientific and technical activity in any field should be reduced to the development of \textit{knowledge bases} of various \textit{intellectual portals of scientific and technical knowledge}. At the same time, the \textit{knowledge base} of each such portal should be decomposed into fragments included in the Library of reusable components of \textit{knowledge bases} of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, which can hierarchically fit into each other. To do this, the specified components must be specified accordingly.
\item  Developers of any \textit{intelligent computer system} should \uline{decompose} the developed system into a set of components included in the Library of components of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} — so that the development of any similar system is reduced to the assembly of components from this Library.
\item \uline{All}(!) developers should take care of \uline{expanding} the Library of reusable (typical) components of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, which will significantly reduce the complexity of developing new \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems} within the Ecosystem of such systems. At the same time, the authorship of the components of the specified Library should be \uline{encouraged}, which is the fundamental basis for the development of the knowledge market, the knowledge economy.
\end{itemize}
\hspace{1mm} If we competently develop and use the Technology
of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, then
the development of any new \textit{intelligent computer system} will mainly be reduced to its automatic assembly
from the components of this system specified by the
developer. Some components of the \textit{intelligent computer
system} being developed may be included in the current
state of the Library of Components of \textit{next-generation
intelligent computer system}, and some of them will
require additional development. But at the same time,
each such new component is most often the result of
modification of existing components from the specified
\newgeometry{left=22.1mm, top=21mm, right=17.5mm, bottom=20mm}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Library and \underline{must be} specified and included in this Library.
Thus, the developer of an applied \textit{intelligent computer
system} should develop not only this system, but also
contribute to the development of a Library of Components
of \textit{next-generation intelligent computer systems}, as a
result of which the next \textit{intelligent computer system}
he is developing can be assembled without additional
components being developed, but only from components
of the Component Library. If all developers of applied
systems act in this way, then the rate of increasing
the level of automation of \textit{human activity} will increase
significantly.\\

\begin{itshape}{A. Social responsibility of specialists in the field of
Artificial intelligence}\\
\end{itshape}
\newline
The current stage of development of the theory and
practice of \textit{Artificial Intelligence} exposes a whole range
of problems that hinder this development [4], [5]. Further
development of \textit{Artificial Intelligence} technologies
\begin{itemize}
    \item on the one hand, it can and quite quickly make
the transition of modern society to a fundamentally
new level of its evolution, providing \underline{comprehensive}
automation of all types and areas of \textit{human activity}
subject to automation, as well as providing the maximum possible comfort and the maximum possible
disclosure of the creative potential of \underline{each} person;
\item on the other hand, it can quite long and quite convincingly \underline{imitate} the specified progress of automation of
\textit{human activity} for an illiterate layman — any even
very worthy goal can be ruined by the imitation of
its achievement;
\item on the third hand, can quickly enough lead \textit{human
society} to degradation and self-destruction.
\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.5cm}As a result, at the present stage of development of
\textit{Artificial intelligence} technologies, the \underline{level of social}
\underline{responsibility} of specialists in the field of \textit{Artificial
intelligence} is a determining factor in the development
of \textit{human society}. The danger to \textit{human society} does not
come from \textit{intelligent computer systems}, but from the
motivation of specialists who develop these systems. It is
obvious that the creation of \textit{intelligent computer systems}
designed for the \underline{deliberate} infliction of any damage to
\textit{human society}, and requiring the creation of appropriate
intellectual means of ensuring security, is a shortcut to
self-destruction.\\
 \hspace{3cm}The efforts of specialists in the field of \textit{Artificial
intelligence} should be aimed at significantly increasing
the level of intelligence of \textit{human society} as a whole, the
basis of which is the \underline{complex} automation of all those
types and areas of \textit{human activity} that fundamentally
makes sense to automate.
\\
\newline
\textit{B. The global goal of Artificial Intelligence activities}
\\
Why the current stage of activity in the field of \textit{Artificial
intelligence} requires the formulation of the \underline{global goal}
of this activity and its permanent clarification.

\hspace{0.5cm}The current state of \textit{Artificial Intelligence} can be
characterized as a deep methodological crisis caused by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the fact that scientific results in this area came out
of scientific laboratories and began to have a real
practical impact;
\item the lack of understanding that obtaining serious
scientific results in a particular field and the creation
of \underline{technologies} that ensure the \underline{effective} practical
use of these results are tasks commensurate in
importance and complexity. This is especially true
for \textit{Artificial Intelligence}.
\end{itemize}

\hspace{0.5cm} The latter circumstance leads to unjustified euphoria,
the illusion of well-being and to a burgeoning eclecticism
that completely ignores even the seemingly obvious laws
of the general theory of systems.

\hspace{0.5cm}Unfortunately, local implementation of the results of
scientific research in the field of  \textit{Artificial intelligence},
local automation of business processes of any organization
without taking into account the system organization of the
entire complex of methods and automation tools of various
types and areas of human activity leads to unjustified
duplication of results.

\hspace{0.5cm}If in the near future there is no awareness of the
global (strategic) goal of work in the field of  \textit{Artificial
Intelligence}, then activities in this area as a whole will
be carried out in the style of "swan, cancer and pike"
. Wasting effort will not lead to a holistic, practically
meaningful result. The "vectors" of specific areas of this
activity, the "vectors" of our efforts will not have the
same focus, which will significantly reduce the overall
productivity of all these activities and the quality of the
overall (total) result.

\hspace{0.5cm}What should be the  \textit{strategic problem} (super problem)
that experts in the field of  \textit{Artificial intelligence} should
solve. It is obvious that such a super task is the transition
of the entire complex of  \textit{human activity} to a fundamentally
new level of maximum possible automation, within which
 \textit{creative} activity remains a fundamentally non-automated
part of human activity, in particular, research activities,
teaching and educational activities, permanent increase in
the level of complex automation of  \textit{human activity}. The
main goal of \underline{complex} automation of  \textit{human activity} is
not only to automate what \underline{can be effectively} automated
using \textit{Artificial Intelligence} methods, but to automate
\underline{all}(!) "bottlenecks" of \textit{human activity} that determine its
overall performance in various fields.

\hspace{4mm}As a result, at present, \textit{Artificial Intelligence} technologies are on the threshold of transition to a fundamentally
new level of development — on the threshold of transition
from solving private (local) problems to solving the global
\end{multicols}
\newpage
\begin{multicols}{2}
of  \textit{human activity}, which requires automation of solving
not only private urgent and important problems, but also
automation of the solution more and more high-level
problems, for which the problems that are being automated now become sub-problems. In other words, when
automating the solution of complex problems (supervising
problems), automation focuses on the development of
methods and means of \underline{interaction between the means of
solving local problems} (particular problems).\\
\hspace{4mm} Shifting the focus to automation of solving not just \textit{intellectual problems}, but to automation of solving \underline{complex}
problems, the sub-problems of which are a \underline{variety of}
\textit{intellectual problems}, not only takes \textit{Artificial Intelligence}
technologies to a fundamentally new level, but will also
have a significant impact on \underline{all aspects of human activity}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item research and scientific and technical work should
acquire a convergent mutually enriching character;
\item the basis of education should be interdisciplinarity;
\item the basis of global automation of human activity
should be a general complex formal and permanently
improved theory of human activity, which should be
based on an interdisciplinary convergent methodology aimed at overcoming the eclectic approach.
\end{itemize}
\hspace{1cm}  Consequently, the main goal of complex automation
of various types and areas of human activity with the
help of \textit{interoperable intelligent computer systems} is to
significantly increase the \textit{level of intelligence} of human
society as a whole.\\
\hspace{0.4cm}  Modern \textit{human society}— is a complex distributed
multi-agent \textit{cybernetic system}, the development of which
is carried out, unfortunately, in violation of many laws of
Cybernetics and, in particular, in violation of the criteria
that determine the level of \textit{intelligence} of hierarchical
multi-agent systems. The level of \textit{intelligence} of such
systems is determined by a number of seemingly obvious
factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item what is the volume and quality of knowledge accumulated by a multi-agent system and available to all
agents (subjects) included in this system
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
\item how much of this knowledge is sufficient to
organize the management of the activities of this
system;
\item to what extent is this knowledge correct (consistent) and adequate;
\item how great is the convergence, compactness and
purity of this knowledge (the presence of information garbage, information duplication is taken
into account here);
\item how well structured (systematized) is the accumulated knowledge;
\end{itemize}
\item how each agent of a multi-agent system has access
to the knowledge stored in the shared memory of
the entire multi-agent system;
\item how this knowledge accumulates and evolves, how
a multi-agent system learns itself
\begin{itemize}
\item how a multi-agent system learns from its own
mistakes,
\item how a multi-agent system improves the quality of
its knowledge;
\end{itemize}
\item how the multi-agent system as a whole and each
agent in particular use the knowledge accumulated
in the shared memory to solve various problems.
\end{itemize}
As a result, if we consider modern human society from
the standpoint of the theory of multi-agent systems, which
are communities of intelligent systems (not only artificial,
but also natural intelligent systems), it is obvious that the
next stage of its evolution requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item automation of accumulation, analysis and permanent
improvement of the quality of knowledge accumulated by mankind;
\item automation of the effective use of knowledge accumulated by mankind in solving problems of various
levels that require the formation of various short-term
or long-term communities of people and intelligent
computer systems. Each such community is intended
either to solve any one specific problem, or to solve
some set of problems in some area;
\item increasing the level of convergence of knowledge,
methods, actions, as well as new technical systems
being created;
\item improving the level of interoperability for both
intelligent computer systems and people.
\end{itemize}

developers cannot create interoperable
